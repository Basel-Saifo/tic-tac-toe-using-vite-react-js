# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


Correct General Steps to Run a Vite-React Project

Assuming you have cloned the project repository and have Node.js installed, here are the standard steps:

1. Install Dependencies

This step uses the command you provided.

    Open your terminal in the project's root folder.

    Run the installation command:
    Bash

    npm install
    # or the shorthand: npm i

    This reads the package.json file and downloads all necessary libraries (like React, Vite, etc.) into the node_modules folder.

2. Start the Development Server

This is the crucial missing step to run the app.

    Run the start command, which is usually defined in the package.json file under "scripts" (often as dev or start for Vite).
    Bash

npm run dev
# or sometimes: npm start

This command typically starts a local development server and provides a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173) where you can view the Tic-Tac-Toe game in your web browser.
